## Introduction
This repository contains the teaching material and notes for the UNIX-based (bash) command line.

## Planning for current class
This class is conducted mostly extemporaneously typing and executing commands (live) in the class while explaining them. Following links provide a good starting point for basic concepts and commands:
* [Week 1 Reading](https://github.com/FooCoding/CommandLine/blob/master/Week1/Lecture.md)
* [Week 2 Reading](https://github.com/FooCoding/CommandLine/blob/master/Week2/Lecture.md)

## Learning goals for this module
* To know the terminal/bash/command line for UNIX based systems.
* Navigate the file system without using a UI explorer.
